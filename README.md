the purpose and functionality of the webpage is to help people build their garden blueprint To start the user will type in which zone there in then they can add plants to their garden from the search bar pulling from the api library, they can set up how they would like their garden to be laid out by drag and dropping them on the grid if there is two plants next together that don't grow well together they will be flagged in red for the user to see and change. however if there's two plants that work well together they'll be highlighted in green. There will also be a drop down on each plant in their garden library for suggested plants that work well with each plant that's selected. After they're done setting up how they want their garden to look they can scroll down and see a already laid out suggested start date calendar for the plants in their garden once done the user should be able to download the page to their pc or print it out so they can have it while bringing their garden to life
